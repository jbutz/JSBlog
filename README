This is a simple web application written using several technologies that will locally store (using the HTML5 localStorage feature) posts that you create. It also has the ability to backup and restore posts since they will not transfer between computers.

This is main a tool for me to practice HTML5 and backbone.js, though it could be used as a journal or something since it is stored locally.

** Note: localStorage does not work in Firefox 5 unless it is being run through a webserver. Opening the local file does not work. This does work, however, in Chromium.
